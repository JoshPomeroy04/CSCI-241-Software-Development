	<h1>How To Play ConnectN</h1>
	<p>You alternate placing pieces on the game board against the computer.</p>
	<p>Your goal is to connect a certain amount of your pieces in a row while preventing
		the computer from connecting their pieces. For small, you must connect 3 to win.
		Medium requires 4. Large requires 5.</p>
	<p>To place your piece, press one of the buttons below the column in which you want to place.
		The piece will start at the top of the column then fall until it reaches the bottom or 
		another piece.</p>
	<p>Good luck!</p>
