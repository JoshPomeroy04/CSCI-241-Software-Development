A GUI-based Connect-N game based on the student's P1

# Notes to graders:
This code base was made on Windows 11.
I would like to use 2 late days on this project.

# v1.0
GUI ConnectN is fully functional. A human player plays against the computer in Connect 4, Connect 3, or Connect 5. Player's can save their top score under a username if their score is good enough. Instructions on how to play can be found in the Menu bar in the top left of the window. The player can play again after win, loss, or tie. 

# v0.3
Computer actively plays against the player on all 3 board sizes. The computer will play the best move on the board, it will play a move that would result in the computer winning the game or play a move that will stop the player from winning the game. Game is fully functional, leaderboard GUI is made but not yet functional.

# v0.2
GUI has full functionality other than the leaderboard option in the menu. Computer now plays a piece after the player plays a piece. Turn counter and computer move display are functional. The board size can be switched to all three sizes. There is no win detection yet.

# v0.1
GUI is made although mostly still unfunctional. Player can open the instructions menu to see how to play. Player can also place pieces on the board until the board is full, nothing happens once the board is full.
