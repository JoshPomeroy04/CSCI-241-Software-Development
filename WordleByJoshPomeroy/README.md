Wordle was created by software engineer and former Reddit employee, Josh Wardle, and was launched in October 2021.

This project extends the base game created by Gilbert G. Le Blanc by adding two additional game modes to the game. A mode where the player guesses a 3 letter word and one where the player guess a 7 letter word. Additionally adds a leaderboard and a hint button.
